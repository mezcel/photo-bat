# photo-bat
A personal multimedia transfer hack for Win to iOS

> This formats multimedia files to be read by the iPad via Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit

#### Working WIP
This is just a quick and dirty script. I was playing with BATCH and learning "ancient" DOS scripting. Enclosed is a PoweerShell equivalent.
```diff
- WARNING! I dont have any error traps.
- So read the prompts and dont commit the final step untill you agree with the confirmation screen.
```

#### Enclosed
* Batch (Dos Executable)
* Text (just Ascii Art)
* PowerShell (Alternate Windows Executable) Extra File

##### Dependancies:
* iPad (i still have and use the iPad 1)
* Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit
* multimedia

I have not made the Bash version yet.. but you get the gist. It will be the same thing but Bash-ed
